#Project Title: 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

This repository contains solutions to the "0x1E. C - Search Algorithms" project. The project focuses on implementing various search algorithms in the C programming language.


##Description
In this project, we implement different search algorithms in the C programming language. The algorithms covered include:

> Linear search
> Binary search
> Jump search
> Interpolation search
> Exponential search
> Advanced binary search
> Jump search in a singly linked list
> Linear search in a skip list

Each algorithm is implemented according to specified requirements and constraints, including function prototypes, space and time complexities, and coding style.

##Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you should be able to:

> Understand the principles behind various search algorithms.
> Implement search algorithms in C.
> Analyze the time and space complexity of search algorithms.
> Adhere to coding standards and project requirements in C programming.

##Requirements

> Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
> All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific flags.
> The code must use the Betty style and pass the Betty checks.
> No global variables should be used.
> Each function should have a maximum of 5 functions.
> Only printf from the standard library is allowed; no other library functions are allowed.
> Prototypes of all functions should be included in a header file named search_algos.h.
> All header files should be include guarded.

##Tasks
The project is divided into several tasks, each focusing on implementing a specific search algorithm or analyzing its complexities.

1. Linear search

2. Binary search

3. Big O #0

4. Big O #1

5. Big O #2

6. Big O #3

7. Big O #4

8. Jump search

9. Big O #5

10. Interpolation search

11. Exponential search

12. Advanced binary search

13. Jump search in a singly linked list

14. Linear search in a skip list

##Files

> search_algos.h: Header file containing function prototypes.
> Task-specific .c files: Implementation files for each task.
> README.md: This file providing an overview of the project and its contents.

##Usage

To compile the files, you can use the provided compilation commands for each task. For example:

bash

gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 0-main.c 0-linear.c -o 0-linear

Then, run the executable generated to test the algorithm:

bash

./0-linear
Follow similar steps for each task to compile and test the search algorithms.
